                        <p>Every once in a while an album escapes the pressing plant a little less pristine than it should be. 
                            If this is the case, please contact us before returning the defective product, so that we can know to expect it and can 
                            be prepared with a new copy for you. Please note that defective product must be returned within 30 days from date of purchase and 
                            should have proof of purchase from Dang Bang Records.</p>
                        <p>Returned product may be exchanged for the same item or returned for a refund. You, the customer, are initially responsible for 
                            the cost of shipping the item back to Dang Bang Records, but will be reimbursed for these charges once we have received the item back. 
                            If an item is purchased in our physical store, please note that it is returnable only for store credit or exchange for the same item, no cash refunds.
